A list of files to build basic containers that will run a kubernetes cluster inside.

The end product is a single docker container that runs a kubernetes cluter with one node.
We build the end system with alpine linux image, and the light weight distribution of
alpine linux.

You MUST launch the container with "--privileged" flag so that the container can
mount overlayfs inside.

An installation of helm is included so that you can manage k8s packages with ease.
Use "k3s kubectl" instead of "kubectl" to access the k3s cluster, please.
